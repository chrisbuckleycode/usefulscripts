# Summary

Solar system 2-D animation simulator, sun and planets (including moons), Tkinter-based.

# Usage Reminder

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisbuckleycode/usefulscripts.git
$ cd usefulscripts/solar-system-sim
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk # needed on Linux Mint 20.3, may already be installed with your Python
$ python3 app.py
```

# Notes
- Up/Down arrows vary the speed.
- Left/Right control the zoom.

# Future Ideas
- Dimensions need to be validated and possibly fixed (inner planets particuarly look too large).
